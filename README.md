Getting Started: 

    - Link to game: 

    - Instructions: Click on a card to flip it over. Each card has a double somewhere else on the board - try to find it! To win, you must find all of the matches within the time limit. Keep in mind, you can only flip over two cards at a time!

Next steps: 

    - Expansion! Create an option to play on a larger board (6x6).
