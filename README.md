# Project 1: Ocean Memory Game

## Description:
A simple, ocean-themed memory game built for my first General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive project.

## Technical Requirements
1. Render game in browser
2. Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML
3. Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
4. Use vanilla JavaScript or jQuery
5. All code should be properly indented and formatted
6. No remaining dead or commented out code
7. Code in a consistent manner
8. Project should be deployed online using gitHub

## Technologies Used: 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* GitHub Branching

## Getting Started: 

* [Link to game](https://ocean-memory-game.netlify.app)

* Instructions: Click on a card to flip it over. Each card has a double somewhere else on the board - try to find it! To win, you must find all of the matches within the time limit. Keep in mind, you can only flip over two cards at a time!

## Next steps: 

* [Expansion!](https://github.com/emilyaikens/Project-1-Extension) Create an option to play on a larger board (6x6)
* Themes! Allow user to select different themes for the game eg. space cats, botanical, robots etc.

## Project Hurdles
* Card flip - new for me
* getting the cards to flip back over, because the timer, clear array before timer, set new timer. Coudln't be at the same time beause flip depends on array.
